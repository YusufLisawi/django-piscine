<h1>Brief Introduction to Django</h1>

<p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It provides a robust set of tools and features for building web applications quickly and efficiently.</p>

<h2>History of Django</h2>

<p>Django was created in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison while working at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper in Kansas, USA. They needed a framework to build web applications rapidly and decided to create their own.</p>

<p>Django was released as an open-source project in July 2005, and it gained popularity quickly due to its simplicity, scalability, and emphasis on best practices.</p>

<p>In 2008, the Django Software Foundation (DSF) was formed to support and maintain the development of Django. The DSF ensures the long-term stability and growth of the framework.</p>

<p>Over the years, Django has evolved and introduced numerous features, including an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer, a powerful template engine, built-in authentication and authorization, form handling, internationalization support, and more.</p>

<p>Django has been widely adopted by developers and is used by many popular websites and organizations, including Instagram, Pinterest, Mozilla, and The Washington Post.</p>

<p>The latest stable version of Django, as of September 2021, is Django 3.2, with regular updates and improvements being released by the Django community.</p>
